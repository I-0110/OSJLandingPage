# OSJLandingPage
My first project doing a webpage with an image background. The buttoms in the webpage do not take anywhere since it is an example. More is expected to be added in the future as I learn more cool stuff to create webpages and eventually websites!
## indexLanding file
This link is the main webpage, the HTLM file. This project was guided by Coding X App under Web X and their second Mini Project. 
## styleLanding file
This link has all the css to make this webpage pretty! I used some resources from [Flat UI]([url](https://flatuicolors.com/palette/us)) colors and [Pexels]([url](https://www.pexels.com/photo/multi-colored-facades-of-urban-houses-16215566/)) photos.
